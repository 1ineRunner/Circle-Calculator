# Circle-Calculator



This was a small, simple high school project coded in Python

Calculate the other variables and properties of a circle from any given radius and optionally provided units

There are some functionalities to the program like: 
    - Text scaling with zoom buttons +/-
    - Changing text colour
    - Help dialogue


Plan to change the circle image to a modifiable chart that will change when a new radius is entered
